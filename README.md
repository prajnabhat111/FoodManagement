# FoodManagement

A machine learning project that predicts the num of people who will actually attend the event you are planning at your house, office etc. Then predicts the quantity of 5 different dishes such as rice, rasam etc. 

By doing this the food wastage at events reduces significantly as the history is refered to predict the new data. The clarity in the food to be prepared helps in food management.

The dataset is very less as it was collected from their actual sources and are accurate. 

the below are the snapshots of the project:
